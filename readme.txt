The **errnio plugin** reaches out to errnio servers and includes the errnio **gesture recognition code**. The gesture recognition code taps into your visitor gestures, performed on your site, and analyses which errnio engagement action or monetization unit will work effectively. errnio works with various 3rd party advertisers by connecting the right offers to the right gesture in the right context in and the right time - **ONLY** and **EXCLUSIVELY** within the errnio gesture functions. We never inject ads into your site!
Using the unique **errnio** plugin maximises your full engagement and monetization potential on mobile web with no banners or taking any more of your site real-estate. The plugin senses finger gesture actions users perform, and offers up your content gallery upon a certain swipe left command, while also disabling any other zoom or scroll gesture axes when engaging the user with the swipe gallery.
